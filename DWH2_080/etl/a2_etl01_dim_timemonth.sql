-- Assignment 2 ETL: dim_timemonth
-- HINT: Generate months from 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31, compute:
--   month_key (YYYYMM), year_num, quarter_num, month_num, month_name, mfirst_day, mlast_day, days_in_month
-- EXAMPLE SHAPE (replace with your complete solution):
-- TRUNCATE TABLE dwh2_xxx.dim_timemonth;
-- WITH months AS (...)
-- INSERT INTO dwh2_xxx.dim_timemonth (...)
-- SELECT ... FROM months;

-- Make A2 dwh2_xxx, stg2_xxx schemas the default for this session
SET search_path TO dwh2_080, stg2_080;

-- =======================================
-- Load dim_timemonth

-- Step 1: Truncate target table, the dim_timemonth
TRUNCATE TABLE dim_timemonth RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- Step 2: Insert data into the dim_timeday
-- 1a) Time (months) for 2023-01 .. 2024-12
